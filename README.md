# odin-recipes

Hello! This a recipe project for Project Odin. It is a basic HTML site. In it I use links, images, ordered and unordered lists, paragraphs, etc. I was reminded to check for typos. In that process, I learned how to delete a github repository and as well as how to delete a directory with content in it (rm -r DIRECTORY NAME). I created another repo for odin-recipes (no typos) and moved it to my local machine (git clone SSH). Looking forward to what's next!
